The system that was installed in my home consisted of:

1. [Main control panel (1)](ControlPanel.pdf)
2. [Door sensors (4)](DoorSensorPlug.JPG)
3. [Window sensors (5)](FlatDoorWindow.pdf)
4. [Smoke and Heat (2)](SmokeHeat.pdf)
5. [Glass break (1)](GlassBreakManual.pdf)
6. CO detector (2)
7. Thermostat, Z-Wave (1)
8. Door Lock, Z-Wave (1)
9. [Medical alert panel (1)](KeyPad.pdf)
10. Telephone card (1)

### #1 Main control panel notes:

I removed #10, the Telephone card to brake any connection to the alarm company.  I still use the panel for everything else but without #10 I can't monitor any thing.  That is why I implemented DACSS.

I am using the main control panel to give voice alerts for things like "low battery", "tamper", and door or window openings when I want them.

### #6 CO detector notes:
During the process of this project the CO detectors "expired" their 5 year life.  I looked into replacing them with the original model but they were very expensive compared to a First Alert and seemed to require a professional to install them.  I did find the model from another source but they said the warranty started when I bought it.  I don't think that is correct, there is a substance in the detector that "expires".  They couldn't give me the date of manufacture.  I suppose I could have bought them then and when they "expired" before the warranty period I could have forced a replacement.  I didn't feel like bothering with that.
I purchased some First Alert CO & Smoke Alarms (Z-Wave) but have not "included" them in the system yet.

### #7&8, Z-Wave devices:
I have integrated these into the OpenHAB System but I don't consider them part of this effort.
