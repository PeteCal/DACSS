### Duplicate A Commercial Security System

DACSS duplicates the security system that was installed in my house.  It uses all the existing sensors including, door, window, smoke/heat, etc.  Using OpenHAB it can do everything the existing system did except call the police.  It does send a text and email about 6 seconds after a breach.  I plan to add the option of calling the police in the future.
